## [0.4.0] - 2015-09-12

### Breaking Changes
- "request" extension moved to [jsonld-request][]. This was done to simplify
  the core JSON-LD processing library. In particular, the extension pulled in
  RDFa processing code and related dependencies. The old method of using this
  exension of `jsonld.use('request')` is deprecated in favor of using the new
  module directly.
- The `jsonld` tool moved to [jsonld-cli][]. This was also done to simplify the
  core JSON-LD processing library and because it uses the [jsonld-request][]
  module.

## [0.3.26] - 2015-09-01

## Before 0.3.26
