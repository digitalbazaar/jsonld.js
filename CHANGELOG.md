# jsonld ChangeLog

### Added
- Expansion and Compaction using scoped contexts on property and `@type` terms.
- Expansion and Compaction of nested properties.
- Index graph containers using `@id` and `@index`, with `@set` variations.
- Index node objects using `@id` and `@type`, with `@set` variations.
- Framing default and named graphs in addition to merged graph.
- Value patterns when framing, allowing a subset of values to appear in the output.

## 0.5.18 - 2018-01-26

### Changed
- Use the W3C standard MIME type for N-Quads of "application/n-quads". Accept
  "application/nquads" for compatibility.

### Fixed
- Fix fromRdf with input triple having a nil subject.

## 0.5.17 - 2018-01-25

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Release 0.5.x as latest branch. See the many many changes below
  since 0.4.x including many potential breaking changes.

## 0.5.16 - 2018-01-25

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `jsonld.version` API and `pkginfo` dependency. This
  feature added complexity and browser issues and the use case is likely
  handled by semantic versioning and using a proper dependency.

### Fixed
- Do not use native types to create IRIs in value expansion.
- Improved error detection for @container variations.
- Handle empty and relative `@base`.
- Remove shortcut from compactIri when IRI is a keyword (fixes compact-0073).

### Changed
- Set processingMode from options or first encountered context.
- Use array representation of @container in processing.
- **BREAKING**: Check for keys in term definition outside that expected:
  `@container`, `@id`, `@language`, `@reverse`, and `@type`. This also sets up
  for additional keywords in 1.1.

## 0.5.15 - 2017-10-16

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use RDF JS (rdf.js.org) interfaces for internal
  representation of dataset and quads. This should only break
  code that was using undocumented internal datastructures,
  backwards-compat code exists to handle external RDF parsers.
- Update `rdf-canonize` to dependency with native support.

## 0.5.14 - 2017-10-11

### Fixed
- Allow empty lists to be compacted to any @list container term. Fixes
  compact-0074 test.

## 0.5.13 - 2017-10-05

### Fixed
- Remote context retrieval bug.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `promisify` API.

## 0.5.12 - 2017-10-05

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Remove top-layer errors.

## 0.5.11 - 2017-09-28

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated extensions API, including `jsonld.request`.

## 0.5.10 - 2017-09-21

### Added
- Add `expansionMap` and `compactionMap` options. These
  functions may be provided that will be called when an
  unmapped value or property will be dropped during expansion
  or compaction, respectively. The function map return either
  `undefined` to cause the default behavior, some other
  value to use instead of the default expanded/compacted value,
  or it may throw an error to stop expansion/compaction.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated `objectify` and `prependBase` APIs. Now
  `objectify` can be achieved via the `@link` option in framing and
  `prependBase` can be found via `url.prependBase`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated `namer` option from all public APIs, use
  `issuer` instead.
- **BREAKING**: Last active context used is no longer returned as an optional
  parameter to the `compact` callback.
- **BREAKING**: Do not expose deprecated `DocumentCache`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Change default canonicalization algorithm to `URDNA2015`.

### Changed

## 0.4.0 - 2015-09-12

### Breaking Changes
- "request" extension moved to [jsonld-request][]. This was done to simplify
  the core JSON-LD processing library. In particular, the extension pulled in
  RDFa processing code and related dependencies. The old method of using this
  exension of `jsonld.use('request')` is deprecated in favor of using the new
  module directly.
- The `jsonld` tool moved to [jsonld-cli][]. This was also done to simplify the
  core JSON-LD processing library and because it uses the [jsonld-request][]
  module.

## 0.3.26 - 2015-09-01

## Before 0.3.26
