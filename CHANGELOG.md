# jsonld ChangeLog

### Changed
- Update `rdf-canonize` to 2.0.1.
- **NOTE**: The `rdf-canonize` update changes browser support and removes forge
  in favor of the WebCrypto `crypto.subtle` API. A WebCrypto polyfill *may* be
  required if a jsonld.js API is used that calls `rdf-canonize`. The polyfill
  is needed if older browsers are targeted or when not using a secure context
  on some modern browsers. Due to other concerns and the expected minimal
  impact of this change, it is happening in a minor release. Please provide
  feedback if this decision causes problems.
- Node.js 6 is no longer tested due to development tool dependency updates and
  to avoid adding additional testing complexity. Node.js 6 will otherwise still
  be supported until the next major release. Please report any issues found.

## 3.2.0 - 2020-10-13

### Fixed
- Empty-property scoped context should not effect the outer context. Note that
  in situations where this fix is used there is now an extra clone of the
  active context which could potentially cause performance issues.

## 3.1.1 - 2020-05-22

### Fixed
- Fix XHR document loader Link header processing.

## 3.1.0 - 2020-04-15

### Fixed
- Support recusrive scoped contexts.
- Various EARL report updates.
- Fixed `prependBase` to start path with a '/' for a zero length path
  if there is an authority in base.

### Changed
- Better support for using a processed context for `null` and caching
  `@import`.
- Don't set `@base` in initial context and don't resolve a relative IRI
  when setting `@base` in a context, so that the document location can
  be kept separate from the context itself.
- Use `package.json` `version` field for EARL reports.

## 3.0.1 - 2020-03-10

### Fixed
- Exclude `@type` from added values in Merge Node Maps step 2.2.1.

## 3.0.0 - 2020-03-10

### Notes
- This release adds support for a majority of JSON-LD 1.1. Significant thanks
  goes to Gregg Kellogg!
- **BREAKING**: A notable change is that the framing `omitGraph` default
  changed to match the JSON-LD 1.1 Framing spec. This is likely to cause issues
  in most current uses of `frame()`. Result handling similar to
  `framed['@graph'][0]` will have to be changed. Check your code.
- The spec calls for various situations to issue warnings. This is currently
  done with `console.warn`. This will be replaced by a new event notification
  API in an upcoming release.

### Fixed
- More support for `"@type": "@none"`.
- JSON literal value handling issues (`null` and `[]`).
- Always pass `typeScopedContext` to `_expandObject`.
- Allow a keyword to exist when expanding in `_expandObject` when the key is
  `@included` or `@type`.
- Improve `isDouble` to look for big integers.
- URI `removeDotSegments` only ensures preceding '/' if was already absolute.
- Do minimal checking to see if IRIs are valid by making sure they contain no
  whitespace.
- Terms of the form of an IRI must map to the same IRI.
- Terms of the form of a relative IRI may not be used as prefixes.
- Match spec error code "invalid context entry" vs "invalid context member".
- Keywords may not be used as prefixes.
- Handle term definition on `@type` with empty map.
- Handling of `@` values for `@reverse`.
- Changes in object embedding.
- Better support for graph framing.
- Better frame validation.
- Wildcard matching on `@id` and other `requireAll` semantics.
- Default frame for lists.
- Check unused scoped contexts for validity.

### Changed
- Keep term definitions mapping to null so they may be protected.
- **NOTE**: `LINK_HEADER_REL` in `lib/constants.js` has been deprecated and
  renamed to `LINK_HEADER_CONTEXT`. It remains for now but will be removed in a
  future release.
- Changed framing defaults
  - `embed` to "@once" and warn on "@first" or "@last".
  - `pruneBlankNodeIdentifiers` based on processingMode.
  - `omitGraph` based on processingMode.
- Replaced `removePreserve` with `cleanupPreserve` and `cleanupNulls`.
- Remove unused framing `graphStack` code that was removed from the spec.

### Added
- Support for `"@import"`.
- Added support for `@included` blocks
- Skip things that have the form of a keyword, with warning.
- Support for expansion and compaction of values container `"@direction"`.
- Support for RDF transformation of `@direction` when `rdfDirection` is
  'i18n-datatype'.
- Top level `@graph` omitted if `omitGraph` is `true`.
- Check for invalid values of `@embed`.
- Support default values for `@type` when framing.

## 2.0.2 - 2020-01-17

### Fixed
- More support for `"@type": "@none"`.
- JSON literal value handling issues (`null` and `[]`).
- Fix resolving context `null` values.

### Changed
- `isKeyword()` optimization for non-keyword fast path.

## 2.0.1 - 2019-12-10

### Fixed
- JSON literal value handling issues.

## 2.0.0 - 2019-12-09

### Notes
- An important **BREAKING** change in this release is the removal of callback
  support in favor of Promises and async/await. This release does **not**
  include a backwards compatible layer. If you need callback support, please
  use the 1.x releases, the Node.js `callbackify` feature, or another similar
  utility library. Suggestions on how best to provide a backwards compatibility
  layer are welcome.

### Fixed
- Expanding the value of a graph container which is already a graph object
  generates a recursive graph object.
- Compacting multiple nodes in a graph container places them in `@included`.
- Indexing on `@type` requires `@type` to be either `@id` or `@vocab`, and
  defaults to `@id`.
- Expanding/compacting type scoped contexts uses context before applying
  new versions to look for type scopes.

### Changed
- Default processing mode changed to json-ld-1.1. Allows a 1.1 context to be
  used after non-1.1 contexts.
- Indexing on an arbitrary property, not just `@index`.
- `@vocab` can be relative or a Compact IRI in 1.1, resolved against either a
  previous `@vocab`, `@base` or document base.
- Better checking of absolute IRIs.
- Terms that begin with a ':' are not considered absolute or compact IRIs.
- Don't use terms with `"@prefix": false` or expanded term definitions to
  construct compact IRIs.
- `@type` may be used as a term definition only if `"@container": "@set"`.
- Improve support for term propagation.
- Context propagation no longer strictly related to use for property-scoped
  or term-scoped contexts and can be overridden.
- Refactored internal context resolution. Processed context cache feature
  added. To be documented later.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove callback API support. This includes removing support
  for callback-based document loaders and RDF parsers. This is done to
  facilitate JSON-LD 1.1 document loader features and to remove deprecated
  code.
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated `loadDocument` API and obsolete
  `DocumentCache`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated support for parsing legacy dataset format.

## 1.8.1 - 2019-10-24

### Fixed
- Run babel on canonicalize. Fixes arrow function compatibility issue.

## 1.8.0 - 2019-09-10

### Added
- Support literal JSON.
  - **NOTE**: The JSON serialization is based on the JSON Canonicalization
    Scheme (JCS) drafts. Changes in the JCS algorithm could cause changes in
    the `toRdf` output.

## 1.7.0 - 2019-08-30

### Added
- Support list of lists.

## 1.6.2 - 2019-05-21

### Fixed
- Allow overriding of protected terms when redefining to the same
  definition, modulo the `protected` flag itself.
- Fix type-scoped context application:
  - Ensure values and subject references are expanded and compacted
    using type-scoped contexts, if available.
  - Ensure `@type` values are evaluated against the previous context,
    not the type-scoped context.

## 1.6.1 - 2019-05-13

### Fixed
- Ensure `@type`-scoped terms are limited to their `@type`-scoped object.

## 1.6.0 - 2019-04-17

### Fixed
- Testing: Use explicit id and description skipping regexes.
- Usage of JavaScript Object property names in data.
  - **NOTE**: A class of bugs was causing term names such as `toString`,
    `valueOf`, and others to be dropped or produce bogus output. The fix could
    cause output triples to differ from previous versions if those special
    names were used.
  - Specifically, the problem was using `x in obj` instead of
    `obj.hasOwnProperty(x)` or a `Map`.
  - Fixed usage in contexts for expand and compact.
  - Attempted fixes in other parts of the code with similar `x in obj` usage.
    Finding actual realistic failing test cases proved difficult.

### Changed
- Testing: Improve skip logging.

### Added
- Testing: `skip` and `only` flags in manifests.
- Testing: `VERBOSE_SKIP=true` env var to debug skipping.
- Support `@protected`.
- Support experimental non-standard `protectedMode` option.

## 1.5.4 - 2019-02-28

### Fixed
- Handle `<subject> <rdf:first> <rdf:nil>` triple.

## 1.5.3 - 2019-02-21

### Fixed
- Improve handling of canonize test cases.
- Update rdf-canonize dependency to address N-Quads parsing bug.

## 1.5.2 - 2019-02-20

### Changed
- Switch to eslint.
- Optimize ensuring value is an array.

## 1.5.1 - 2019-02-01

### Fixed
- Update canonize docs.

## 1.5.0 - 2019-01-24

### Changed
- [rdf-canonize][] updated:
  - **BREAKING**: A fix was applied that makes the canonical output format
    properly match the N-Triples canoncial format. This fixes the format to no
    longer escape tabs in literals. This may cause canonical output from
    `jsonld.normalize()`/`jsonld.canonize()` to differ from previous versions
    depending on your literal data. If a backwards compatibility mode is
    needed please use 1.4.x and file an issue.
  - **BREAKING**: [rdf-canonize-native][] was removed as an indirect optional
    dependency and the JavaScript implemenation is now the default. The former
    `usePureJavaScript` flag was removed and a new `useNative` flag was added
    to force use of the native bindings. Higher level applications must
    explicitly install `rdf-canonize-native` to use this mode. Note that in
    many cases the JavaScript implemenation will be *faster*. Apps should be
    benchmarked before using the specialized native mode.
  - **NOTE**: The Travis-CI C++11 compiler update fixes are no longer needed
    when using jsonld.js! [rdf-canonize-native][] was updated to not use C++11
    features and is also no longer a direct or indirect dependency of
    jsonld.js.

### Fixed
- `rdfn:Urgna2012EvalTest` and `rdfn:Urdna2015EvalTest` tests should compare
  with expected output.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-01-05

### Changed
- PhantomJS is deprecated, now using headless Chrome with Karma.
  - **NOTE**: Using headless Chrome vs PhantomJS may cause newer JS features to
    slip into releases without proper support for older runtimes and browsers.
    Please report such issues and they will be addressed.
- Update webpack and babel.
- Use CommonJS style in main file.
  - **NOTE**: This change *might* cause problems if code somehow was still
    using the long deprecated `jsonldjs` global. Any dependants on this feature
    should update to use bundler tools such as webpack or use `jsonld` in the
    distributed bundle.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-01-04

### Fixed
- Use rdf-canonize to compare n-quads test results.
- Maintain multiple graphs.
- Sort `@type` when looking for scoped contexts.

### Changed
- Use JSON-LD WG tests.
- Categorize and skip failing tests.

## 1.2.1 - 2018-12-11

### Fixed
- Fix source map generation.

## 1.2.0 - 2018-12-11

### Notes
- The updated [rdf-canonize][] extracted out native support into
  [rdf-canonize-native][] and now has an *optional* dependency on this new
  module. If you have build tools available it will still build and use native
  support otherwise it will fallback to less performant JS code.
- If you wish to *require* the native `rdf-canonize` bindings, add a dependency
  in your code to `rdf-canonize-native` to insure it is installed.
- Some systems such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) currently only have
  ancient compilers installed by default. Users of `rdf-canonize`, and hence
  `jsonld.js`, previously required special setup so the `rdf-canonize` native
  bindings would be installable. If CI testing is not performance critical you
  can now simplify your CI config, let those bindings fail to install, and use
  the JS fallback code.

### Changed
- Update `rdf-canonize` dependency to 0.3.

### Added
- Initial support for benchmarking.
- Basic callback interface tests.
- Add README note about running json-ld.org test suite.

### Removed
- Callback version of every test.
  - Callback interface tests added to catch callback API errors.
  - Avoids duplication of running every test for promises and callbacks.
  - Simplifies testing code and makes async/await conversion easier.

## 1.1.0 - 2018-09-05

### Added
- Add `skipExpansion` flag to `toRdf` and `canonize`.

## 1.0.4 - 2018-08-17

### Fixed
- Fix `_findContextUrls` refactoring bug from 1.0.3.

## 1.0.3 - 2018-08-16

### Changed
- Improve performance of active context cache and find context urls:
  - Use Map/Set.
  - Cache initial contexts based on options.
  - Reduce lookups.
- Update webpack/karma core-js usage:
  - Add Map, Set, and Array.from support.

## 1.0.2 - 2018-05-22

### Fixed
- Handle compactArrays option in `@graph` compaction.
- Many eslint fixes.
- Add missing await to createNodeMap() and merge().

## 1.0.1 - 2018-03-01

### Fixed
- Don't always use arrays for `@graph`. Fixes 1.0 compatibility issue.

## 1.0.0 - 2018-02-28

### Notes
- **1.0.0**!
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is now past the "initial
  development" 0.x.y stage (after 7+ years!).
- [Conformance](README.md#conformance):
  - JSON-LD 1.0 + JSON-LD 1.0 errata
  - JSON-LD 1.1 drafts
- Thanks to the JSON-LD and related communities and the many many people over
  the years who contributed ideas, code, bug reports, and support!

### Added
- Expansion and Compaction using scoped contexts on property and `@type` terms.
- Expansion and Compaction of nested properties.
- Index graph containers using `@id` and `@index`, with `@set` variations.
- Index node objects using `@id` and `@type`, with `@set` variations.
- Framing default and named graphs in addition to merged graph.
- Value patterns when framing, allowing a subset of values to appear in the
  output.

## 0.5.21 - 2018-02-22

### Fixed
- ES2018 features are being used. Update version check to use generated Node.js
  6 code when using Node.js earlier than 8.6.0.

## 0.5.20 - 2018-02-10

### Fixed
- Typo handling legacy N-Quads dataset format.

## 0.5.19 - 2018-02-09

### Fixed
- Include String startsWith() compatibility code.

## 0.5.18 - 2018-01-26

### Changed
- Use the W3C standard MIME type for N-Quads of "application/n-quads". Accept
  "application/nquads" for compatibility.

### Fixed
- Fix fromRdf with input triple having a nil subject.

## 0.5.17 - 2018-01-25

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Release 0.5.x as latest branch. See the many many changes below
  since 0.4.x including many potential breaking changes.

## 0.5.16 - 2018-01-25

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `jsonld.version` API and `pkginfo` dependency. This
  feature added complexity and browser issues and the use case is likely
  handled by semantic versioning and using a proper dependency.

### Fixed
- Do not use native types to create IRIs in value expansion.
- Improved error detection for `@container` variations.
- Handle empty and relative `@base`.
- Remove shortcut from compactIri when IRI is a keyword (fixes compact-0073).

### Changed
- Set processingMode from options or first encountered context.
- Use array representation of `@container` in processing.
- **BREAKING**: Check for keys in term definition outside that expected:
  `@container`, `@id`, `@language`, `@reverse`, and `@type`. This also sets up
  for additional keywords in 1.1.

## 0.5.15 - 2017-10-16

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use RDF JS (rdf.js.org) interfaces for internal
  representation of dataset and quads. This should only break
  code that was using undocumented internal data structures,
  backwards-compat code exists to handle external RDF parsers.
- Update `rdf-canonize` to dependency with native support.

## 0.5.14 - 2017-10-11

### Fixed
- Allow empty lists to be compacted to any `@list` container term. Fixes
  compact-0074 test.

## 0.5.13 - 2017-10-05

### Fixed
- Remote context retrieval bug.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `promisify` API.

## 0.5.12 - 2017-10-05

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Remove top-layer errors.

## 0.5.11 - 2017-09-28

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated extensions API, including `jsonld.request`.

## 0.5.10 - 2017-09-21

### Added
- Add `expansionMap` and `compactionMap` options. These
  functions may be provided that will be called when an
  unmapped value or property will be dropped during expansion
  or compaction, respectively. The function map return either
  `undefined` to cause the default behavior, some other
  value to use instead of the default expanded/compacted value,
  or it may throw an error to stop expansion/compaction.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated `objectify` and `prependBase` APIs. Now
  `objectify` can be achieved via the `@link` option in framing and
  `prependBase` can be found via `url.prependBase`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated `namer` option from all public APIs, use
  `issuer` instead.
- **BREAKING**: Last active context used is no longer returned as an optional
  parameter to the `compact` callback.
- **BREAKING**: Do not expose deprecated `DocumentCache`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Change default canonicalization algorithm to `URDNA2015`.

## 0.5.9 - 2017-09-21

### Fixed
- Callbackify bugs.
- Document loaders.
- Request queue.
- Handling of exceptions in callbacks.

### Added
- Various toRDF tests.

### Fixed
- Generate all js files for Node.js 6.

## 0.5.3 - 2017-09-20

### Changed
- Significant code reorganization and splitting into multiple files.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Explicit IE8 support. Webpack, babel, and/or polyfills may be
  of help if support is still needed.
- **BREAKING**: jQuery document loader. Use the XHR loader.
- `Object.keys` polyfill. Other tools can provide this.

### Fixed
- Handling of "global".

## 0.5.2 - 2017-09-19

### Fixed
- Distribute browser files.

## 0.5.1 - 2017-09-19

### Fixed
- Distribute unminified bundle.

## 0.5.0 - 2017-09-18

### Added
- Add .editorconfig support.
- `fetch-test-suites` and related `fetch-*-test-suite` NPM scripts.
- Support for `@graph` `@container`.

### Removed
- Bower support. Use NPM, a NPM proxy site, or build your own bundle.
- Makefile. Use NPM script targets.

### Changed
- Update url parser to remove default ports from URLs.
- Skip spec version 1.1 tests.
- **BREAKING**: Only support Node.js 6.x and later with ES2015 features.
- Build and use custom Node.js 6.x output so async/await/etc can be used.
- **BREAKING**: Move `js/jsonld.js` to `lib/jsonld.js`.
- **BREAKING**: Switch to CommonJS.
- **BREAKING**: Fixes to allow RFC3986 tests to pass. Some URI edge cases and
  certain base URIs with dot segments may cause different URI outputs.
- Switch to Karma for browser testing.
- Switch to webpack to build browser bundles.
- Add explicit feature compatibility libs to browser bundles.
- Use async APIs for test generation.
  - Done to allow testing in Node.js and browsers.
  - Required major testing changes to make everything async.
  - Workarounds added to get async generated mocha tests working.
- Improved support for loading various types of tests.
  - Can load local files, test manifests, or plain js files (in Node.js).
- Use ES2015 in tests and babel/webpack to support older platforms.
- Use rdf-canonize library, remove local implementation.

## 0.4.12 - 2017-04-24

### Fixed
- Fix `promises.compact` API when called with only 2 parameters.

## 0.4.11 - 2016-04-24

### Changed

### Changed
- Add optimization for compacting keywords.

## 0.4.9 - 2016-04-23

### Changed
- Add optimizations for \_compactIri.

## 0.4.8 - 2016-04-14

### Fixed
- Revert es6-promise dependency to 2.x to avoid auto-polyfill behavior.

## 0.4.7 - 2016-04-14

### Fixed
- Testing document loader.

## 0.4.6 - 2016-03-02

### Added
- Add `headers` and `request` option for node doc loader.

### Changed
- Include local tests.

## 0.4.5 - 2016-01-19

### Fixed
- N-Quads comments pattern.
- Local tests.

## 0.4.4 - 2016-01-08

### Fixed
- Document cache in default node document loader is broken; disable
  until HTTP caching is implemented.

## 0.4.3 - 2016-01-05

### Fixed
- N-Quads may contain comments.

## 0.4.2 - 2015-10-12

### Added
- Add inputFormat and algorithm options to normalize.

### Changed
- Add support for normalization test suite.
- Support URDNA2015 normalization algorithm.
- Add async scheduling of normalization algorithms.

### Fixed
- Ignore null values in language maps.

## 0.4.1 - 2015-09-12

### Changed
- Ignore jsonld-request and pkginfo for browserify.

## 0.4.0 - 2015-09-12

### Breaking Changes
- "request" extension moved to [jsonld-request][]. This was done to simplify
  the core JSON-LD processing library. In particular, the extension pulled in
  RDFa processing code and related dependencies. The old method of using this
  extension of `jsonld.use('request')` is deprecated in favor of using the new
  module directly.
- The `jsonld` tool moved to [jsonld-cli][]. This was also done to simplify the
  core JSON-LD processing library and because it uses the [jsonld-request][]
  module.
